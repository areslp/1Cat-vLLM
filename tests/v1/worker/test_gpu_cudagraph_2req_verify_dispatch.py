"""CPU checks for two-request DFlash2 verify-batch cudagraph dispatch.

A single resident decoder produces a clean uniform verify batch every step
(1 req x (1 + num_draft) tokens, all draft tokens present) and replays the
captured FULL decode cudagraph -> GPU-bound. With two resident decoders the
verify batch is only dispatched to a FULL graph when it is *also* a clean
uniform verify shape (e.g. 2 reqs x 8 tokens, both carrying 7 drafts). When the
two decoders fall out of lock-step the batch is non-uniform (uniform_tok_count
becomes None) and dispatch must fall back to the PIECEWISE/eager forward. That
eager forward, launch-bound over a long context, is the reqs>1 host-time cost
measured with py-spy; these checks pin the dispatch decision so a future fix
(capturing FULL graphs for more verify shapes, or keeping the decoders aligned)
can be validated against the intended behavior."""
