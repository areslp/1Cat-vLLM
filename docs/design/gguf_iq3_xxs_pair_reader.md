# IQ3_XXS reader for shared-activation pairs

The next seven IQ3_S/IQ3_XXS gate/up pairs reuse the two-reader M8 kernel
from the IQ3_S/IQ4_XS path and the source-sized records described in
`gguf_iq3_xxs_pair_records.md`. The IQ3_XXS reader loads three aligned
16-byte packets per K128 record, caches original d across K256 halves,
and advances pointers without recalculating block addresses in the loop.
It retains the original seven sign bits and four-bit small scale per K32.

Operand formation calls `LatticeRawDecoder<18>::table_fragment<half>`.
The existing original-block decoder owns the FP16 operand proof and scale
formula. This reader adds no quantization formula, scale expansion or
rounding policy. Dot products and split-K reduction retain FP32 arithmetic
in the existing shared-activation skeleton.

The raw operator builds both IQ3_XXS/IQ3_S orientations alongside the two
existing IQ3_S/IQ4_XS orientations. Byte checks distinguish 98/110/136-byte
blocks. Host launch code is shared; the existing two kernel instantiations
retain their implementation. Actual-weight GPU checks and the matched cold-L2 graph comparison pass
in both orientations. Model capability declarations admit only
M8/N4352/K5120 on SM70 with FP16 operands; all other descriptors retain
canonical dispatch. Source-sized IQ3_XXS records are prepared alongside
the existing independent IQ3_S reader.

Ten CPU record/cursor checks pass. The new cursor oracle covers all eight
split-K starts for K5120, including odd starts, two N32 tiles, all columns
and all sixteen octets per K128 record. Reconstructed index bytes, sign/scale
words and cached original d match the source. An initial oracle failure was
caused by using big-endian integer parsing in the test; specifying the
original little-endian byte order fixes the oracle without changing the
reader. The normal CUDA 12.8 SM70 extension and complete wheel build pass. Both
IQ3_XXS orientations use 63 registers, 34,816 shared bytes, zero stack and
zero local memory. Existing IQ3_S/IQ4_XS instantiations retain 64 registers
and 33,792 shared bytes. The installed wheel imports both normal extensions
and passes native-member hashes and dependency checks without private DSOs.
Actual layer2 and layer38 TP4 slices pass official-dequantization FP32-GEMM
checks across three seeds: native relative L2 is 0.000503–0.000536 and
0.000507–0.000516, respectively. Runtime M512/8/1/5/16/20/32/8 and graph
replay checks pass; other M retain bitwise canonical results.

Cold-L2 graph ABBA uses 16 MiB eviction before each event, 84 samples,
V100 SXM2 32GB, fixed SM/memory 1290/877MHz and 300W, Torch 2.10 cu128
and CUDA 12.8. Both orientations read 18,104,320 source bytes per pair.

| Gate/up types | Canonical ABBA arms | Native ABBA arms | Source bandwidth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IQ3_XXS/IQ3_S | 86.016/86.016us | 57.344/57.344us | 315.7GB/s |
| IQ3_S/IQ3_XXS | 87.040/87.040us | 58.368/58.368us | 310.2GB/s |

Seven layers save an estimated 0.201ms of projection service per round,
covering another 16.954% of mixed-pair source bytes. Together with the
IQ3_S/IQ4_XS pair, 18/40 mixed layers cover 48.463% of mixed-pair bytes.
This is a weighted microbenchmark estimate, not an end-to-end result.
The first GPU attempt failed while the filesystem was full; its controller
and logs are retained. Duplicate archived artifacts were retired before
repeating the operator checks. Model integration checks pass as recorded below.

## Shared-activation hardware counters

A separate one-node CUDA graph capture profiles the already admitted pure
IQ3_S gate/up operator from the normal installed wheel. It uses actual
layer6 TP4 weights, M8/N4352/K5120, a 16MiB flush before the node,
fixed SM/memory 1290/877MHz and 300W. No private extension is loaded.
Ordinary-user counter permission failed; an authorized privileged retry
passes under the same GPU leases. The failed capture is retained.

| Actual total counter | Earlier signed pair | Shared-A pair |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| L1 global read bytes | 68,497,152 | 33,221,120 |
| L2 read sectors times 32 | 31,000,096 | 31,044,928 |
| DRAM read bytes | 19,466,304 | 19,457,728 |

L1 read demand falls 51.5%, while measured total L2 traffic is essentially
unchanged. These totals do not identify activation-only L2 bytes. The
profiled 47.360us service and 7,837,952 warp instructions are counter evidence,
not an unprofiled speed result. Excess shared wavefronts remain 911,091;
shared activation reuse does not remove the codebook conflict. The earlier
two-copy parity lookup was measured equal in latency and remains rejected.

## Installed model integration

The normal installed wheel passes TP4 target/Q8_0 DFlash2 AOT startup and
M8 full graph capture on V100-SXM2-32GB with ring NVLink, Torch 2.10 cu128,
CUDA 12.8, FP16 KV and FP32 SSM. The 32K configuration uses a 1024-token
batch budget, one sequence and seven probabilistic draft tokens. The
quality check requests M8 capture and uses temperature 0.7/top-p0.9/top-k20
and seed 123, with thinking disabled and EOS respected. Arithmetic returns
`391`; the unit-testing question receives one reasonable English sentence.
Both prompts naturally stop within 128 tokens.

Four rank reports each admit all seven IQ3_XXS/IQ3_S mixed pairs. This
extends the existing eight pure and eleven IQ3_S/IQ4_XS pairs, while
the remaining 22 mixed layers retain canonical dispatch. An initial report
checker incorrectly traversed duplicate linear reports and null draft
entries after successful model startup. That failure is retained; the
corrected checker reads only the loaded GGUF-layer report and was validated
on the previous eleven-pair report before repeating the quality check.

Both native modules in the final wiring wheel are bitwise identical to
the measured raw-operator wheel. Its complete SHA256 is
`b3d977e7445cf61edfbfe1c39968dcc813e91d1704a5b575127ea995b6172624`.
The subsequent integration of main's affine head-layout and ordered-row
changes passes 39 focused dispatch/head-layout CPU checks without changing
the mixed-pair readers or their measured shape. This is model integration
and text-health evidence, not an end-to-end latency comparison.
