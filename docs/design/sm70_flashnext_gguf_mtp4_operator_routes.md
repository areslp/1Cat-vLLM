# Flash-Next GGUF MTP4 operator integration

The target verifier dominates the original Flash-Next IQ3_S speculative
round. Floating projection restoration, batched FP32 HC, packed vocabulary
projection and small-batch expert alignment are measured as separate
operators before complete-model integration. Operator service savings do not
predict emitted-token throughput when speculative acceptance changes.

Latest combined measurement: C1 26.072 ms/round and 92.267 decode tokens/s;
C4 52.059 ms/round and 280.441 aggregate decode tokens/s. All four natural
EOS outputs match the original token IDs. This version repeats deterministically,
while fixed-length trajectories differ from prior versions. The 15–17 ms goal
is still open. The combined measurement section records exact provenance.

## Workload

Flash-Next GSQ-RCO IQ3_S, FP16 MTP4, TP4 on four V100 SXM2 32 GB cards.
Driver 580.173.02, Torch 2.10 CUDA 12.8, Python 3.12.3. Activations and KV
are FP16; SSM state and kernel accumulation are FP32. The TP topology has
direct NVLink edges 0–1, 0–2, 1–3 and 2–3; diagonals use SYS.

The engine uses maximum length 8704, four sequence slots, batch budget 512,
memory utilization 0.9 and ring policy auto. Decode graphs are FULL; mixed
prefill/decode uses the independently resolved PIECEWISE policy. C1 uses 8192
input tokens and 256 output tokens. C4 uses 128 input tokens and 1024 output
tokens per request. Timing cohorts use greedy sampling and ignore EOS for
fixed output length. Separate natural greedy prompts respect EOS. Each
candidate is measured three times; the original C1 has one repeat and the
original C4 has three. No profiler is attached to these measurements.

## Earlier complete-round comparisons

The first candidate, source `39442cce7b`, combines floating restoration,
packed FP32 router, replicated batched FP32 HC and the merged GGUF runtime
dispatch correction. It retains dense FP16 vocabulary weights and legacy
expert alignment. The later candidate, source `5fb07b92b8`, additionally
extends GDN a/b row dispatch through M=32, prepares Q6_K packed vocabulary
projection and uses fused expert alignment/restoration. It retains the
existing expert GEMM implementations.

| Candidate | C1 round (ms) | C1 tokens/s | C1 full acceptance length | C4 round (ms) | C4 tokens/s | C4 full acceptance length |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Original ring auto | 41.499 | 75.212 | 3.036 | 65.624 | 262.269 | 3.830 |
| Floating/HC integration | 36.747 | 93.788 | 3.459 | 66.061 | 202.019 | 3.055 |
| Packed head and fused routing | 30.932 | 78.803 | 2.643 | 56.924 | 258.219 | 3.403 |

Round time is total measured engine time divided by steady intervals;
throughput is total emitted tokens divided by that same time. Full acceptance
length comes from the complete request's speculative counters and includes
the bonus token. These populations differ. The latest steady emitted tokens
per request and round are 2.4375 at C1 and 3.674745 at C4.

The latest C1 repeats each contain 80 steady intervals and 195 emitted tokens,
with 98 draft rounds, 392 drafted tokens and 161 accepted draft tokens.
C4 repeats each contain 196 steady intervals and 2881 emitted tokens across
four requests, with 1205 draft rounds, 4820 drafted tokens and 2896 accepted
draft tokens. Token IDs and speculative counters are identical within each
candidate workload across repeats.

The latest candidate reduces C1 round time by 10.567 ms, but reduced
acceptance limits the throughput improvement over the original to 4.8%.
C4 round time falls by 8.699 ms; throughput is still 1.5% below the original.
The first candidate's C4 regression is substantially reduced but the
nonregression check has not passed. This result does not isolate individual
operator effects or confirm a cause of the acceptance differences.

All four natural prompts have the same token IDs as the original ring-enabled
runtime and finish normally at EOS, with lengths 2, 2, 2 and 63 tokens.
The longer Chinese response gives a coherent explanation of Rayleigh
scattering. Fixed-length timing trajectories differ between candidates;
natural-output agreement must not be claimed for all ignored-EOS tokens.

## Route and artifact checks

The latest ordinary package is `1.5.2.dev538` from `5fb07b92b8`. Its wheel
SHA256 is `df4b0bc86258d594f8ef0806cff9722d59a8a653636929f083b8ca05fd075a07`.
The packaged core SHA256 is
`0a8f4f3a2cfd4153cbfff09ff009f0be1745f1fa9f8fc437250742894ca113e1`.
Native source matches the separately built batched HC artifact; the ordinary
wheel contains the Python route changes. Fresh-process provenance and
standard Torch/CUDA linkage were checked before launching the model.

Worker records admit `GGUFLMHeadMethod` for the Q6_K vocabulary shard
`[62080, 2560]`. Logs confirm FP32 replicated HC, a/b row GEMV at M=5/10/15/20,
router top-k and fused expert alignment at those batch sizes. The target
and MTP proposer share the packed vocabulary head. No new model trace has
been captured for these candidates.

## Follow-up recorded before joint experts

The next step at that stage was to check the fused output reduction against the original Torch FP32
operation on the admitted geometry. Its initial sequential sum differs from
Torch's four-accumulator ordering; a local operator comparison can remove
that discrepancy without another complete-model restart. This is an
implementation difference, not a demonstrated cause of acceptance loss.

The expert grouped-vector work reuses original-block decoders from #897.
The checkpoint's gate/up tensors include IQ3_XXS in 17 layers, IQ2_S in 20,
IQ3_S in 10 and IQ4_XS in one; filename alone cannot select a decoder.
Dense quantized projection tuning remains separate. Further model profiling
follows qualified floating-route integration.

## Joint experts and PLE integration

The next source-containing installed wheel is `1.5.2.dev560+g22e3ff90d`,
with the same Flash-Next IQ3_S, FP16 MTP4, TP4, KV/state dtypes, batch budget,
sampling and C1/C4 request lengths as the previous operator integration.
It adds joint original-block IQ2_S/IQ3_S gate/up, calibrated canonical
IQ4_NL/Q2_0 down vectors, exact Torch-order unroute reduction and batched
PLE n-gram IDs. Unmeasured points retain canonical dispatch; the slower
IQ2_S gate/up and down-vector M=20 points remain excluded.

| Candidate | C1 round ms | C1 tokens/s | C1 full acceptance length | C4 round ms | C4 tokens/s | C4 full acceptance length |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Previous operator integration | 30.932 | 78.803 | 2.643 | 56.924 | 258.219 | 3.403 |
| Joint experts and PLE | 26.668 | 90.544 | 2.560 | 54.748 | 258.709 | 3.485 |

C1 saves 4.264 ms per round and improves throughput by 14.9% against the
previous integration; against the original ring-enabled model it saves
14.831 ms and improves throughput by 20.4%. The 26.668 ms round is below
the separately recorded 27.4 ms NVFP4 MTP4 reference, but that comparison
alone does not establish equivalent emitted-token throughput or quality.
C4 saves 2.176 ms against the previous integration while throughput changes
by +0.19%. C4 remains 1.36% below the original ring-enabled throughput; this
result does not establish a strict C4 non-regression gate. The 15–17 ms round
target is not reached.

Each of the three C1 repeats records 82 steady intervals and 198 emitted
tokens, or 2.414634 emitted tokens per interval. Full-request speculative
counters contain 100 drafts, 400 drafted tokens and 156 accepted tokens.
Each C4 repeat records 257 steady intervals and 3640 emitted tokens across
four requests, or 3.540856 per request and interval. Full-request counters
contain 1177 drafts, 4708 drafted tokens and 2925 accepted tokens. Token IDs
and speculative counters match across all three repeats in each cohort.
Acceptance counters cover the full request rather than only the steady
interval window and must not replace its emitted-token denominator.

Four natural greedy prompts finish normally: Paris, arithmetic, Chinese
translation and a 63-token explanation of Rayleigh scattering. All four
match original model token IDs. These are text-health checks, not a broad
quality-set result. Timing cohorts use fixed output lengths with EOS ignored;
natural prompts honor EOS.

Runtime logs confirm joint original-block type21/type22 at M=5, type21 at
M=20, both down formats at 50 routed rows, fused small expert alignment,
FP32 replicated HC, a/b row GEMV at M=5/10/15/20, router and QSA top-k,
and batched PLE n-gram IDs. The ordinary installed artifact passes 46 CPU
checks plus 42 GPU/mixed-bank cases, all 211 dependency checks and fresh
native import. No private DSO, preload or library override is needed.

Model storage is 24.18 GiB per rank. The profiler leaves 2.75 GiB for KV,
69,360 tokens; captured graphs add about 0.38 GiB. The additional original
expert banks are retained only for type21/type22; type18's measured M=5 gain
does not justify another 2.55 GiB per rank in this integration. There is no
new model trace in this measurement.

## Node trace after operator integration

Nsight Systems 2024.6.2 captures the already qualified
`1.5.2.dev560+g22e3ff90d` package. Graph 14 is the target verifier;
graphs 26 and 38 are draft graphs. Each of four workers has 75 complete
target launches with 2175 nodes, versus 3194 nodes in the original trace.
Analysis uses the middle 59 target-to-next-target intervals per worker,
excluding eight transitions on either end. The immutable raw SQLite is
retained separately from the derived target-replay selection.

| Target category | Calls per rank/round | Mean rank service (ms) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| HC combine and gates | 386 | 3.580 |
| TP ring, including readiness waits | 98 | 3.415 |
| Bitplane projections | 131 | 3.026 |
| Canonical down vectors | 48 | 2.002 |
| Joint original-block gate/up | 30 | 1.973 |
| Remaining lattice projections | 34 | 1.870 |
| LUT4 projections | 87 | 1.622 |
| QSA/indexer | 72 | 1.609 |
| Router/shared gate | 144 | 1.145 |
| Copy/cast | 273 | 0.931 |
| Index/reduce/scatter | 145 | 0.727 |
| Fused expert route/unroute | 96 | 0.553 |
| FP16 row GEMV | 36 | 0.122 |
| Packed PLE UVA gather | 1 | 0.100 |
| PLE n-gram IDs | 1 | 0.003 |

Original-block type22/type21 gate/up, canonical type20/type42 down vectors,
fused expert route/unroute, row GEMV, FP32 batch HC, router top-k, QSA and
packed PLE UVA are present in actual nodes. Remaining type18 gate/up uses
34 canonical vector launches per target round. It was excluded from dual
original storage because that adds 2.55 GiB per rank for a smaller measured
M5 benefit.

The target activity envelope averages 29.800 ms per rank and draft graph
service averages 4.226 ms in this capture. These values include profiler
perturbation and cannot replace the unprofiled 26.668 ms complete-round
baseline. Category service can overlap and readiness waits are embedded in
collectives; neither the category table nor per-rank maxima form an additive
wall-clock decomposition.

The remaining copy/scatter work and HC/QSA/router calls merit targeted
operator checks. The packed PLE gather is already using pinned host UVA;
its 0.100 ms service does not establish that it causes host replay skew or
first-collective waiting. Dense quantized GEMV tuning remains in the separate
GGUF kernel work.

The updated first-ring analysis finds only about 3.0–3.3 us of target GPU
work before the collective. Its residual after the last rank arrives is
5.533 us. Arrival spread has median 674.758 us; its mean is 1255.998 us
because one transition has a 37.617 ms outlier. Excluding that one point
reduces the mean to 629.091 us. CPU replay-entry spread has median
653.734 us, consistent with skew before target graph entry. The profiler's
4.4–6.0 ms graph-launch API durations are instrumented values and do not
establish ordinary host cost. PLE causality remains unproven.

Rank0 is last to enter the target graph in 56 of the 59 captured rounds.
CUDA API overlap between the earliest worker's entry and rank0's entry has
median 319.470 us; excluding the one skew outlier gives mean 300.385 us.
The remaining 58 windows contain about 8.88 APIs each, primarily elementwise
and indexed launches plus asynchronous copies. These instrumented APIs
account for part of the observed entry spread rather than an isolated PLE
wait. Their durations are not ordinary host-time savings. Attribution below
the Python/driver boundary requires further evidence before changing
collective synchronization or assigning the wait to the offloader.

## GDN copy follow-up

Projection-tail materialization is merged in #927 and row-strided mixed-QKV
verification in #928. The former writes Z/b/a in one launch while retaining
the QKV view; the latter consumes that physical row stride and avoids the
split/concatenate preparation. Both are restricted to the measured M5/M20
model geometry and preserve FP32 recurrence and state snapshots.

| Local chain, 36 layers | M5 saving ms | M20 saving ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Projection tails | 0.225 | 0.202 |
| Strided recurrent input | 0.494 | 0.545 |
| Direct recurrent output | 0.080 | 0.060 |

The direct output path merged in #929 passes changed-input graph comparisons for output,
convolution state and all FP32 SSM snapshots, including destination canaries.
These synthetic exact-layout chain timings are separate operator measurements
and cannot be summed into a complete-model result. The qualified model remains
the 26.668 ms C1 / 54.748 ms C4 composition above until the next combined run.

A launch-geometry screen of HC combine/norm finds no faster bitwise M5 choice;
the current tile and warp policy is retained. Changing tile width produces
some FP16 output bit differences. The existing rejected QSA score-tile screen
is also retained as a negative result rather than repeated. A replicated HC
up counter sample motivated a next-group weight-lookahead screen. The
candidate preserves intermediate bits but does not improve M5 and regresses
M20; it is reverted in #930. Its counter and ordinary operator timings are
recorded in `sm70_hc_weight_prefetch_screen.md` without model admission.

## Combined GDN copy measurement

Source `3b07077f7318f5947e8771080beeee9d6f4830e5`, ordinary package
`1.5.2.dev915+g3b07077f7`, includes default projection-tail materialization
(#936), row-strided recurrent input (#928), direct recurrent output (#929),
and the existing joint experts. The worker reports actual FULL decode and
PIECEWISE mixed graphs independently; all four ranks captured 5/10/15/20
token FULL graphs. KV pages are 816 tokens, FP16 KV and FP32 SSM state;
MTP weights remain FP16. Hardware and timing lengths match the earlier
TP4 composition: C1 I8192/O256 and C4 I128/O1024, three repetitions.

| Metric | Previous joint experts | Combined GDN copies | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| C1 round ms | 26.668 | 26.072 | -0.596 |
| C1 aggregate decode tokens/s | 90.544 | 92.267 | +1.90% |
| C1 steady emitted/request/round | 2.415 | 2.405 | |
| C4 round ms | 54.748 | 52.059 | -2.689 |
| C4 aggregate decode tokens/s | 258.709 | 280.441 | +8.40% |
| C4 steady emitted/request/round | 3.541 | 3.650 | |

C1 repetitions are 25.782/26.314/26.120 ms; C4 repetitions are
51.658/52.070/52.450 ms. Full-run acceptance length is 2.783 at C1
(92 drafts, 368 proposed tokens, 164 accepted) and 3.020 at C4
(1357 drafts, 5428 proposed tokens, 2741 accepted). These counters include
request tails and are distinct from steady-cohort emitted/request/round.
Within this version, all three repeated output token sequences and acceptance
counters agree exactly. Fixed-length timing sequences differ from the prior
composition, so the full latency difference cannot be attributed entirely to
copy operators. No activation or accumulation precision was reduced.

The four natural EOS prompts retain all original token IDs, including the
63-token Chinese explanation. They finish normally. Against the initial
GGUF MTP4 baseline, C1 throughput increases 22.68% and C4 6.93%; the previous
small C4 regression is removed. C1 round duration is 1.328 ms below the
separately recorded 27.4 ms NVFP4 reference, which is not a matched throughput
or quality comparison. The 15–17 ms target remains unachieved.

`6ee54f6fe296eb6a68f027b6e6611243914bccc7140508829d1132a6b1aac527`.
All 213 package dependencies and six installed worker/RPC serializer checks
pass. The actual standard string RPC records worker graph modes without
allowing insecure callable deserialization.

Two preceding model attempts produced no natural or timing results: one
lacked the worker graph-report field, the other used a callable rejected by
the default Msgpack serializer. Their logs are retained separately; neither
is counted as a benchmark. No additional trace was collected for this run.

## Reproduce the matched composition

Use a normal installed wheel containing the measured operators, with the
shared GPU lock and task-owned compile/JIT caches. Respect EOS for the natural
prompts; ignore it only in the explicitly fixed-length timing cohorts.

```bash
python benchmarks/benchmark_gguf_model.py MODEL.gguf \
  --mtp-draft MTP_MODEL --ring auto --require-installed \
  --prompts-json PROMPTS.json --kv-cache-dtype float16 \
  --ssm-state-dtype float32 --widths 1 4 \
  --input-len 8192 --output-len 256 --concurrent-input-len 128 \
  --concurrent-output-len 1024 --prefill --max-model-len 8704 \
  --max-seqs 4 --max-batch 512 --repeats 3 \
  --gpu-memory-utilization 0.9 --output RESULT.json
```

Fixed-length first-different output positions against the prior joint-expert
artifact are 50 at C1, and 123/46/530/669 for the four C4 requests
(zero-based). This does not alter the observed natural EOS agreement and is
not recorded as strict long-output equivalence.
