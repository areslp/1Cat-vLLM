# Restore GGUF GDN head order during canonical preparation

Head-tiled GGUF output projections currently reorder the activation on every
forward. Affine canonical preparation can instead permute integer codes and
all group coefficients into the model head order before TurboMind packing.
The head dimension must divide into complete canonical groups. Other formats,
unsupported layouts and mixed projections with an unrestorable shard retain
the original input transform. Admission reports restoration and fallback
reasons. This changes no decoder, activation dtype or accumulation precision.

The validation fixture covers head-group factors2 and3, M1/M5/M20/M512,
official Q6_K dequantization and changed-input CUDA graph replay. Flash-Next
uses factor3 and head dimension128; the TP4 output shape isN2560/K1536.
Twenty-six GPU checks cover Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K, both head-group factors and
all four M sizes;15 dense-admission CPU checks pass.

A CUDA graph microbenchmark cycles six distinct real Q6_K output weights,
with alternating A/B order over eight epochs. The six packed banks exceed
V100 L2 capacity. Existing canonical coefficient rounding versus official
GGUF dequantization has maximum absolute error2.0981e-4 and maximum relative
L2 error1.9500e-4 across the six banks. Permuting codes and coefficients adds
no new weight rounding. The different column reduction order produces these
FP16 projection differences:

|M|Input permutation(us)|Restored weights(us)|Maximum output difference|Maximum relative L2|
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
|1|25.140|15.383|1.2207e-4|4.2332e-5|
|5|17.694|15.252|2.4414e-4|2.8794e-5|
|20|20.629|18.274|2.4414e-4|2.1349e-5|

M5 saves2.441us per projection, or about0.088ms for36 projections; this is
an operator-based estimate, not measured full-model latency. M20 saves about
0.085ms for36 projections. The expected graph-node reduction is one copy per
restored projection. Model checks are recorded below.

Reproduce with `benchmarks/benchmark_gguf_head_layout.py MODEL.gguf OUTPUT.json`
using the installed ordinary wheel, CUDA12.8/Torch2.10cu128, V100/SM70, FP16
activation/weights and FP32 accumulation. The stock gguf reader cannot open
this mixed file because Q2_0 has type42; use the project's compatibility reader.

The expanded benchmark cycles all36 real output projections (29 Q6_K,
4 Q5_K,3 Q4_K) with the same TP4N2560/K1536 geometry. Mean time per
projection across the complete layer bank is:

|M|Input permutation(us)|Restored weights(us)|Saving for all36 projections(ms)|
|---|---:|---:|---:|
|1|19.036|14.397|0.1670|
|5|18.010|15.048|0.1066|
|20|21.081|17.984|0.1115|

Maximum FP16 output differences remain1.2207e-4 for M1 and2.4414e-4 for
M5/M20. These are alternating-order CUDA graph microbenchmarks, not model
round timings. Use `--all-output-projections` to run this complete bank.

## Model check

The ordinary wheel from the combined source `8a16ac46d0` runs Flash-Next
IQ3_S with FP16 MTP4, TP4 V100, FULL graphs, FP16 KV/activations and FP32
recurrent state. All36 output projections report restored input layouts.
Eight natural prompts with a128-token budget produce plausible text and reach
the length limit. Compared with the earlier600-token baseline, two128-token
prefixes match exactly; six diverge at positions26,28,47,55,100 and123.
These model outputs are not a bitwise-parity claim. A final600-token paired
acceptance comparison is required after the remaining metadata changes.

Independent C1 I8192/O256 probes give23.5600 and23.5698ms unobserved, with
identical complete IDs across those controls and the23.6095ms observed arm.
C4 I128/O600 gives49.2792ms. These are absolute measurements; the changed
speculative trajectories do not support attributing the full difference from
older model runs to this layout change. Operator-bank savings remain0.1066ms
for M5 and0.1115ms for M20.

Actual CPU replay entry over39 middle rounds has median69.925us,
p90177.035us and maximum262.763us. This cohort meets the100us median
objective, but its tail still exceeds100us. The benchmark's one-shot transfer
diagnostic recorded no blocking-transfer stacks in this run, so those empty
records are not evidence for a particular source call. A direct metadata
microbenchmark is used to validate the separately scoped index-copy change.

The final same-artifact 600-token pair is recorded in
[the graph and acceptance report](flashnext_gguf_graph_parity.md#final-combined-check).
All four target graphs contain 1,763 nodes, confirming removal of all36
head-order copies from the preceding1,799-node graph. The combined GGUF
run gives C1 23.2973/23.6183ms unobserved and C4 48.1459ms. Its paired
acceptance difference versus NVFP4 is −0.957pp (95% interval −3.347 to
+0.929pp); mean acceptance length differs by −0.0383 (−0.1339 to +0.0372).
These intervals do not prove equivalence. Projection-bank tests isolate this
change's 0.1066ms M5 saving; model timings include the separate metadata fix.
