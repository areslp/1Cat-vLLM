# GGUF on V100: implementation and acceptance control

## Scope and integration

Target: extensible standalone GGUF loading on four SM70 V100s, then recover
prefill and C1/C4/C8/C16 throughput against matching native quantization paths.
Integration is `onecat/main`; never change versioned source snapshots for this
campaign. Kernel admission and startup reporting must use KernelConfig and
`vllm/sm70_profiles/acceleration.py`. No new environment switches.

A model generation smoke is not a logits, quality, or throughput acceptance.
Every performance comparison must freeze checkpoint and quantization, GPU
UUIDs/topology, TP/EP, CUDA/Torch/build SHA, context/input/output length,
sampling, MTP, attention backend, graphs, and KV format. Separate prefill,
TTFT, steady decode, and emitted-token throughput. The existing 35B AWQ/FP8
migration gates remain mandatory and are not replaced by a GGUF smoke.

## Ordered review scopes

1. Standalone metadata/tokenizer and qwen35 dense adapter. Preserve GGUF
   vocabulary/token types/chat template; explicit HF config/tokenizer wins.
   Restore GDN negative exp(A_log), convolution dimension, norm offsets,
   tiled value heads, and correctly shard the tiled out projection. Reject
   unknown tensors, missing shards, duplicate tensors, and invalid split counts.
   Mixed FP16/quantized projection shards retain distinct storage and dispatch.
2. qwen35moe adapter: stacked expert types, mixed gate/up expert quantization,
   MTP nextn adapter; verify full logits and greedy output against llama.cpp.
3. qwen4exp adapter: HC, QSA/indexer, and PLE hash constants/table. Use llama.cpp
   conversion/qwen4exp.py as format oracle. Preserve 64-bit hash constants;
   PLE layer IDs differ between GGUF (zero-based) and HF (one-based).
4. llama-family, glm4moe, deepseek2 (including MLA kv_b split), gpt-oss and
   minimax-m2 adapters. Handle architecture-specific RoPE permutations.
5. Modern native kernel closure, with upstream licenses and pinned sources:
   Q1_0, Q2_0, MXFP4, NVFP4, TQ1/TQ2; numerical and route capability gates.
6. Q4_0/Q4_1/Q4_K/Q8_0 load-time repack and rounding report; TurboMind/QPN
   decode, batched GEMM, expert grouping and tensor-core prefill.
7. Remaining types: MMVQ decode, dequant + FP16 GEMM prefill; measured Volta
   fused dequant HMMA for intermediate M; grouped MoE token reuse.

## TP/EP decision

Quantization block alignment is an operator/storage constraint, independent
of model names. K-quant has block K=256: local intermediate K=4352 is aligned;
Flash-Next expert K=640 divided over TP4 gives K=160 and is not aligned.
Do not slice packed bytes at that boundary. Prefer EP with complete experts
when the installed GGUF expert method supports EP; otherwise convert the
unaligned expert tensor at load time to a format with an admitted K boundary.
EP is not considered implemented by setting enable_expert_parallel alone.
Coordinate the final decision with the Flash-Next decode work; its observed
GPU topology differs from the historical full-NVLink baseline.

## Runtime and artifact hygiene

Models and reference builds are under `/mnt/nvme3/ymzx-data`; the volume is
mounted by its existing fstab UUID. GPU work must hold `/tmp/gpu0-3.lock` for
its entire process lifetime and inspect existing GPU processes first. Use
owned compiler caches. Do not use private kernel DSOs/preloads as PR evidence.

Large raw output is retained outside Git, in the owned worktree's `.artifacts`.

### Repack admission finding: Q4_K affine coefficients

27B UD-Q4_K_M: 212,992 sampled group coefficients, 6,815,744 weights,
stratified over all Q4_K tensors (up to 256 superblocks per tensor). Keeping
codes identical and rounding scale and additive min/bias to FP16 gives maximum
absolute weight error 9.9182e-5, RMSE 9.5210e-6 and relative L2 6.7039e-4.
68.2262% of reconstructed FP16 weights differ from direct GGUF dequantization.
This is a CPU coefficient-rounding study, not GPU/model performance or a
quality gate. Q4_K repack is therefore approximate; require full logits and
quality evidence before making it the default. Avoid representing additive
bias as a rounded zero-point ratio: the existing prepare function computes
-zero*scale, which adds another rounding step and fails for zero scale.
A direct affine scale+bias preparation interface is needed for Q4_1/Q4_K.
+### Primary acceptance checkpoint: Flash-Next GSQ-RCO IQ3_XXS

The requested primary checkpoint is
[ISTA-DASLab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-GGUF](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/ISTA-DASLab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-GGUF/files),
IQ3_XXS (not IQ3_S). GSQ-RCO here assigns precision per tensor; it does not
introduce an additional weight rotation.

The first shard is 47,039,860,096 bytes, SHA256
`219ea929900dfa9ef091f3aa473fdba6874b65fcb36526d7d851ac9e95856d15`.
The second is 28,800,138,432 bytes, SHA256
`316b46f3a2dbd68c900f43136ab9449f9dcc3725dfd8c794847c204bc161e113`.
ModelScope file revisions are respectively
`e3a513b7830d32c0d87b07d54ca650cbc422cc26` and
`26dfa70d5c61d623f472c234462b8205ef3448e2`. Downloads use these immutable
revisions, resume into .part files, and require size/SHA256 validation before
rename.

The real first-shard directory has 1,223 tensors and GGML type counts:
F32=292, F16=1, BF16=484, Q4_K=45, Q5_K=15, Q6_K=71,
IQ2_XXS=18, IQ2_XS=20, IQ2_S=20, IQ3_XXS=12, IQ3_S=82,
IQ4_NL=58, IQ4_XS=67, Q2_0=38. The remaining tensor is the IQ4_NL
PLE table (320,001,536 rows of dimension 160), requiring packed sparse lookup.
GPU vocabulary partitions or host mmap must retain the quantized rows; never
materialize the complete table in FP16.

Actual metadata: qwen4exp, 48 layers, H=2560, 24 Q / 2 KV attention heads,
head_dim=256, 512 experts, top-k=10, expert K=640, 16 GDN key / 48 value
heads, 128-dimensional GDN heads, HC count=4/rank=320. PLE keys include
exact int64 multipliers, offsets and prime vocabulary sizes. GGUF PLE layer
index 1 maps to HF layer ID 2. Q2_0 uses K blocks of 64, so expert down
local K=160 still cannot be byte-sliced under TP4; IQ4_NL K blocks of 32
are aligned. Flash-Next retains TP4. Canonical group32 reblocking supports
Q2_0 K=160 shards in the TurboMind operator layer; the canonical MoE model
connection remains pending. The adapter fallback currently converts each
64-value Q2_0 block into two Q4_1 blocks using the same integer values, scale
and additive offset. This preserves decoded values but adds 2.014 GiB per rank
for the 30 affected expert down projections. Replace this temporary storage
with canonical u2 when integrating grouped TurboMind experts.

Three CPU tests cover decoded equality, all four K=160 boundaries and
independent projection storage; three GPU FFN checks compare summed TP
partials with the full expert reference. All 1,224 checkpoint tensors have
adapter names. Full-model generation and quality are still pending.

### Loading validation and open gates

17 metadata/tokenizer/split tests and 13 dense adapter/TP/mixed-storage
tests pass on CPU. Earlier failures localized missing runtime
dependencies, unaligned K-quant FFN storage, missing hybrid state traits,
and KV-head replication when TP exceeds KV heads. Those have source fixes;
alignment and replication have focused CPU coverage. A later run completed
engine initialization and GPU prefill warmup, then rejected the text-only
class's missing MRoPE position interface. That interface is now implemented
and tested on CPU. Inverse A_log loading preserves its FP32 parameter contract
even with FP16 model dtype.

The corrected TP4 tiny Qwen3.5-0.8B Q4_K_M run completed GPU inference on
2026-10-03 with FP16, eager execution, max length 2048, no MTP, FP16 KV,
Flash-V100 attention and FlashQLA GDN. Three raw prompts generated 64 greedy
tokens each. The English and arithmetic sequences matched llama.cpp for all
64 tokens; the Chinese sequence matched its first 13 tokens and then diverged.
First-token full-vocabulary logits have RMSE 0.1243/0.1408/0.1656, maximum
absolute error 0.6073/0.8044/0.8116 and relative L2 0.02949/0.04647/0.06349.
All three top-1 tokens match. The reference is CPU llama.cpp at
`bed0a856606ee4a24a164066f73d2379447033f5`, using identical token IDs.
These numeric differences and the Chinese divergence remain an open quality
gate; a completed inference smoke does not establish adapter correctness.
The following chat harness failed because Transformers 5 returns a dict
from apply_chat_template by default; it now requests return_dict=False.

These are implementation-localization results, not primary-model quality
or speed acceptance. Hold the shared GPU flock and do not terminate other
tasks. No accepted whole-model throughput is recorded.

### Chinese greedy divergence localization

A controlled 20-token run uses the same tiny checkpoint, prompt token IDs,
TP4, FP16, eager execution and no MTP. Single-request legacy inference
chooses token 96617 at step 13 and matches all 20 CPU llama.cpp tokens.
The original three-request batch is reproducible: it chooses token 103911
at step 13. The competing-logit margin (96617 minus 103911) changes from
+0.09375 in the single request to -0.0625 in the batch.

The CPU reference also matches all 20 tokens after exact F32 reconstruction
of every GGUF weight, so CPU activation quantization alone does not explain
the divergence. Replacing the batch's quantized linear calls with the packaged
FP16 dequantization plus GEMM reference restores all 20 reference tokens;
its step-13 margin is +0.203125. Worker dispatch logs confirm this replacement
for Q4_K, Q8_0 and Q6_K. This localizes the correction to the linear numerical
path; a finer separation of activation quantization, weight rounding and
accumulation remains pending. It supports the FP16-activation TurboMind
direction without changing loader mappings.

The first precision-hook attempt patched the Python implementation after
the custom operator had already been registered, so it did not replace the
actual caller. Its outputs are excluded. A separate launch used system CUDA
12.0 for Tilelang and failed before generation; subsequent runs explicitly
use CUDA 12.8. Neither failure is quality evidence. The wider quality suite
and primary-model comparisons are still pending.

### Loader synchronization and installed artifact

After integration at `1d1d1c9d80a762ec6d3c7fd46fb85954f730967f`, the
Qwen3.5 adapter's GDN layout and mixed-projection storage compose with the
packaged native fallback policy. The 19 metadata and 13 adapter contracts pass
both from source and from a fresh ordinary wheel installation. All 210
installed dependencies pass compatibility checking. This Python-only loader
artifact uses the complete normal precompiled operator wheel for that base;
no private extension override is required. Core and native extension hashes
match their packaged and installed copies, without RPATH/RUNPATH.

Loader source: `afad28789341c204ccf3046621124f8ec74b7e39`.
Wheel SHA256:
`177bcd84f73eb63e46cbba602f70d515df472551e7630758599f0b60d9665f61`.
Core SHA256:

`74ed944b8abb0f8679757a4e1bf0acef453f4a9803002f2c47b35b47f39d163f`.

Installed inference uses the same tiny checkpoint and CPU oracle, V100 32GB
GPU0–3, TP4, Python 3.12.3, CUDA 12.8, Torch 2.10.0+cu128, FP16,
maxlen 2048, maxbatch 256, maxseqs 4, 0.1 GPU memory utilization, eager
execution, no MTP and FP16 KV. English/arithmetic still match 64/64 greedy
tokens each. Chinese matches 23 tokens before diverging in this run; this is
not a resolved quality result. A preceding one-token full-logit generation and
new packaged fallback implementation make this a distinct run from the earlier
13-token localization baseline. Its first-logit RMSE/relative-L2 values remain
0.1243/0.02949, 0.1408/0.04647 and 0.1656/0.06349, with matching top-1.

Embedded chat-template generation with thinking disabled returns `Paris`,
`4` and `你好` for the three fixed short prompts. These checks establish
installed loader/tokenizer operation; broader distribution/quality checks and
primary-model speed remain pending. No model-level TurboMind speed is claimed.

## Current-main loader check

The loader was synchronized with main `48a66d2838` without changing other
SM70 routes. All 19 metadata and 13 adapter tests pass from source and a fresh
ordinary wheel installation. The installed tiny-model run uses the same TP4,
FP16/eager/no-MTP contract above: English and arithmetic match 64/64 greedy
tokens; Chinese matches 23 tokens before divergence. First-logit RMSE is
0.128859/0.148466/0.165342, relative L2 is 0.030586/0.049015/0.063375,
and all first-logit top-1 values match. Embedded chat results remain `Paris`,
`4`, and `你好`. Broader quality work remains pending.

The normal packaged `_C` matches the main operator artifact,
`4910c47ab1aaed253001d5950bf44dd40a350b2b087202a8ea2b13f2c5457782`.
Wheel `1cat_vllm-1.5.2.dev406+g7285a28e6.precompiled-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl`
has SHA256 `17a06f4c462608c07006aaf1fb71d902dc1362380a7df0b7d7339d310873345e`;
all 210 installed dependencies are compatible. The subsequent main sync adds
the independently validated IQ3_XXS grouped-vector codebook layout; that
operator is not used by the tiny dense model in this check.

### Canonical dense model integration and coalescing

The installed dense GGUF integration prepares affine, LUT4 and lattice
projections through the shared TurboMind lifecycle. Adjacent compatible shards
coalesce before packing; mixed types retain separate ordered dispatch. Real
projection sweeps select FP16 caching for merged Q8 alpha/beta rows and canonical
DQ+FP32 cuBLAS for calibrated large affine shapes. FP16 activations and FP32
accumulation are preserved. Twelve targeted GPU checks pass from source and
from a fresh normal wheel; the core fingerprint is unchanged.

Qwen3.8-27B UD-Q4_K_M, TP4 on V100 x4, FP16 activation/KV, no MTP,
FULL_AND_PIECEWISE graphs, I1024/O128 and two complete-cohort repeats:
C1/C4/C8/C16 aggregate pure decode is 58.88/216.73/396.87/671.47 tok/s.
These improve the preceding GGUF implementation by 21–24%, while still trailing
the matched NVFP4 control by 12–19%. Prefill at 8K/32K is 2.423/10.263 s,
3.4%/2.0% faster than that control. All four natural greedy sequences and EOS
remain identical to the preceding GGUF run and its llama.cpp reference.

Full operator grids, graph attribution and model workload details are in
`gguf_turbomind_model.md`. The fixed 36-case quality comparison completes with
34/36 for both GGUF and NVFP4: all code, arithmetic and Chinese cases pass,
as do the 8K/32K needles. Both routes fail the 128K/258048-token needles with
repeated `!`. An eager NVFP4 audit localizes the first nonfinite output to
layer 15 attention in the second 8192-token prefill chunk. The captured Q/K/V
are finite; an isolated Q8192 operator reproduces 34 positive infinities.
The sampled tail maximum misses the actual peak by about 17. Tail intermediate
range recovery is tracked in #875, separately from GGUF weight preparation.
The tiny-model 23-token Chinese difference is still open. Flash-Next remains
TP4; its model integration, canonical MoE preparation and packed PLE offloading
remain separate unfinished work.

### Corrected long-context model check

PR #875 is merged. Both GGUF and NVFP4 now pass all four frozen needle cases,
including the previous 128K/258048 failures, with unchanged prompt hashes,
sampling and natural EOS. The 32 preceding short code/math/Chinese cases were
already passing on unchanged attention routes. Updated GGUF decode is
59.49/207.22/394.61/674.61 tok/s; the lower C4 full-sweep mean includes long
intervals despite a faster median. A matched four-repeat C4-only confirmation
is 215.44 tok/s, within 0.6% of the preceding run. 8K/32K engine prefill is
2.4323/10.3453 seconds versus the updated NVFP4 2.4666/10.4106. All four greedy
sequences and EOS remain identical. Full raw measurements and remaining gaps
are recorded in `gguf_turbomind_model.md`; Flash-Next integration remains TP4.
